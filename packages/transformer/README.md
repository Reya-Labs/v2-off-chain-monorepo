# Setting up a Poetry project

Getting started with Poetry
This guide will walk you through setting up a Poetry-based Python project. We will go from an empty directory to a fully configured Poetry environment, ready for development.

1. **Install Poetry**: First, you need to install Poetry on your system. You can install it using the recommended installer:
bash

```commandline
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3
```

This command downloads and installs Poetry. The installer also modifies your PATH variable to include Poetry's executables.

2. **Create a new project directory**: Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal.

3. **Initialize the project**: Run poetry init in the terminal to create a new pyproject.toml file in your project directory. This file contains your project's dependencies and configurations. Follow the interactive prompts to configure your project.

### Understanding the pyproject.toml file

The pyproject.toml file is the central configuration file for your Poetry project.

Here's the breakdown of the pyproject.toml file that's at the root of this package.

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "@voltz-protocol/transformer-v2"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Voltz V2 Google Dataflow Transformer"
authors = ["Voltz Protocol"]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.9"
apache-beam = "^2.46.0"
pytest = "^7.1.3"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
flake8 = "^6.0.0"
black = "^23.3.0"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```
Let's break down each section:

- **[tool.poetry]**: This section contains metadata about your project, such as its name, version, description, and authors.
- **[tool.poetry.dependencies]**: This section lists your project's dependencies. These are the packages required for your project to function correctly. The specified versions use semantic versioning with the caret (^) symbol, indicating compatible versions.
- **[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]**: This section lists development dependencies. These packages are not needed for your project to function but are useful during development (e.g., linters, formatters, testing libraries).
- **[build-system]**: This section specifies the build requirements and build backend for your project. It ensures that the build system used is compatible with your project's configuration.

### The poetry.lock file

The poetry.lock file is automatically generated by Poetry when you install dependencies. It contains the exact versions of all packages installed in your project, including transitive dependencies (dependencies of your dependencies).

The purpose of the poetry.lock file is to provide a deterministic build across different environments. By locking the exact versions of packages, you ensure that the project will behave consistently on different machines or when collaborators work on the same project.


### Leveraging Poetry for Python development

Poetry is a powerful tool that simplifies dependency management, packaging, and publishing of Python projects. It handles virtual environments, streamlining the development process and making it easier to manage dependencies. Some key features of Poetry include:

1. **Dependency management**: Define your project's dependencies in the pyproject.toml file, and Poetry will handle installation, updates, and resolving conflicts.
2. **Virtual environment management**: Poetry creates and manages virtual environments for your project, isolating dependencies and providing a consistent development environment.
3. **Packaging and publishing**: Poetry can build and package your project, making it easy to distribute and share with others. It also
